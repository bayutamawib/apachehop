This an excercise of Data warehousing using Apache Hop. There are 2 ways on running the pipeline:
1. Using sql queries completely: pipeline.hpl (you can get the queries in "by-query" folder)
2. Using sql queries + pyspark: pyspark.hpl (you can use "Execute sql script 1-3" in "by-query" folder, followed by totalsales-avg.py
